      p Vision Zero  
      p We firmly believe in the core principles of <a href="http://www.towardszerofoundation.org/thesafesystem/">  Vision Zero </a> – that no one should be killed or seriously injured on our roads, and that thoughtful city planning and engineering hold the most power to prevent crashes. We’re doing our part to make Vision Zero a reality: 
      ul
        li Our technology quickly enforces slow-ride and no-ride zones to detect and prevent unsafe riding
        li We <a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2021/09/07/sunset4all-celebrates-achieving-crowdfunding-milestone/"> advocate for and invest in </a> smart street designs
